abstract = {Modern manufacturing and quality monitoring involve multi-class out-of-control (OOC) information from the training sample. It is essential to use such information during online monitoring of data streams from complex processes. In this paper, a monitoring framework is designed by combining the random forest technique with the exponentially weighted moving average method for monitoring complex processes with multi-class OOC information. To be specific, a process surveillance technique in the form of a control chart is proposed based on the probability that the online data is classified as an in-control (IC) sample, and the control chart triggers an alarm when the probability is lower than the control limit. Our numerical findings based on the Monteâ€“Carlo simulation show that the proposed control chart performs more effectively than its competitors under various distributions and data types, especially for high-dimensional cases when multi-class OOC information is known in advance. Moreover, the proposed method is illustrated with an application using the data related to the hard disk manufacturing processes. }
